    <h1>A Call for Help</h1>
    <p>The students of St. Vincent Pallotti School are very excited for the Pallottian Quest that will take place tomorrow.
But there seems to be a problem...... A certain someone isn't too happy about this and has created a sentient AI to stop the Pallottian Quest from happening.
Time is running out and if nothing is done about it, we might not be able to have the Quest we wanted.</p>

<p>But there is a way to stop this. All of you are our school's only hope to shut down this AI before it destroys the entire event.</p>

<p>P.S there is a puzzle at the bottom of the page
(When in doubt, select everything)</p>
